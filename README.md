# DMRG-inspired-Algorithms-for-Neural-Network-Compression
## Summary
The files here contain an application of a DMRG-inspired algorithm to compressing neural network layers into an MPS/MPO tensor network structure as well as improvements on the MPO Net by Gao
A full description, longer summary, and results can be found in my thesis itself and my presentation found in the Information folder.

## Purpose
This repository was used for writing my Bachelor Thesis at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich in 2020.
The MPO Net functions were adapted and updated from the MPO Net by Gao found at: https://github.com/zfgao66/deeplearning-mpo.

## Requirements
Python 3

TensorFlow 2
